## Project: ESG Risk Chatbot – Comprehensive ESG Insights and Analysis

During my internship at PwC Tunisia, I developed an ESG Risk Chatbot aimed at generating responses on general ESG topics and company-specific performance analysis. The objective of this project was to provide businesses with meaningful, data-driven insights regarding their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. The chatbot offers automated responses tailored to ESG-related queries, empowering companies to understand their sustainability metrics more effectively.

Project Highlights:

- Data Collection and Processing: Collected and processed ESG risk scores, financial performance metrics, and sustainability data for over 7,800 companies, building a comprehensive dataset designed for large-scale research and analysis.

- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering: Applied advanced data cleaning techniques and feature engineering to extract meaningful ESG indicators, ensuring the data was consistent, accurate, and ready for analysis.

- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Implemented ESG-Bert for automatic text extraction and classification from sustainability reports. This enabled efficient topic modeling and analysis of ESG-related content, contributing to the chatbot’s ability to deliver precise and contextual responses.

- Chatbot Development: Developed a specialized ESG chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the accuracy of information retrieval. The model was fine-tuned using LLaMA3 with LoRa, enabling low-precision inference and ensuring high performance while optimizing for limited GPU resources.

- User Interface Integration: Integrated the chatbot with an intuitive Gradio interface, providing users with a simple, accessible platform to explore general ESG topics and specific company performance metrics.

 ### Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to provide businesses and stakeholders with valuable insights into ESG risks and performance, aiding in the generation of sustainability reports in accordance with CSRD standards. This tool helps ensure conformity, evaluation, and compliance, thereby supporting responsible decision-making based on comprehensive sustainability metrics.
